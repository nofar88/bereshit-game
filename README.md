# Bersheet game
**The game is based on assignment 0, in which we were required to land the Bersheet  spaceship using a PID controller.**

This game aims to teach us a basic understanding of how to make a spacecraft land on the moon without crashing.  
The game relies on the data of the Bersheet spaceship as it crashed on the moon.  
Your goal is to land the spacecraft on the moon with as much fuel as possible without crashing.

## Data source
The code for the spacecraft landing is based on assignment 0, the code itself we took from the GitHub of a couple from the class [here](https://github.com/6arek212/Bereshit-java).
In addition, we used Google to design the various screens.
